# Welcome to items catalog app!

You will find in the compressed file the folder to the project ,
once the application is up and running then you will have access to these features in version 0.1 :

 - you can view currently present categories, and items in those categories.
 - you won't be able to edit / add or delete any of them unless you are logged in.
 - once you are logged in using your google account you will be able to only modify the categories/items you created with that account.
 - only the category owner can delete a category even if contains items that aren't his own..
 

hope you do enjoy the app, wait for version 0.2 released on 26/6/2099 :)!
